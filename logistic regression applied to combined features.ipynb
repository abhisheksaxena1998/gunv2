before read the titlewow that very cool to think how keen their senses must be to recognize and avoid each other and their territories plus like to think that there one from the white colored clan who just goes way into the other territories because well he a badass that really cool the edges are surprisingly defined white wolf is dick constantly trespassing other territories link to story www duluthnewstribune com news science and nature voyageurs national park wolves eating beaver and blueberries not cool to imagine that there are similar zones surrounding all these we just didn tag those wolves you know the white wolf fucked some red bitch for sure it wild how they are all roughly the same size this what am gonna show people when they ask for photo of sixpackthat actually awesome deleted white wolf pack is looking for fighti want to know wtf lives here that the wolf keeps avoiding imgur com tnrsf jpg dataisbeautiful but actually beautiful not here a graph of my heart rate when went on date this is actually gorgeous informative and awesome want more data is the white pack made up of many aggressive wolves so they spread to other territories periodically or is it just the one wolf who doesn give as much of fuck does tighter cluster mean smaller pack or just more territorial what is the age gender and type of wolves that are being tracked so many questions so little information misleadingthumbnails minimap of the grand final of the v age of empires tournamentthe white pack is drawing wolf face white one tried to be naughty little by sneaking into red zone just little bit its amazing how they all seem to be similar in area size that one white wolf is big and bad removed am a wolf if my senses and economic status allowed me to stay so perfectly sequestered from other people would without question it content like this that makes reddit great well done op this is window into the mind of wolf not only do they have clearly defined ranges they have clearly defined packs and each wolf must know each other scent markings am blown away also the blue pack is way too cautious found the location on google maps it looks like the green pack territory covers about sq miles larger than san marino and also includes the nova far detector www burnsmcd com projects nova far detector www burnsmcd com projects nova far detector d love to see something similar but with chimps who actually wage war have soldiers etc something representing this www youtube com watch axuximqym potentially nsfw chimpanzee cannibalism there a white wolf plotting some shit white clan wolf let do this leerooooooooooooooooooooy jeeeeeenkiiiiiiiiiiins this research project is called the voyageurs wolf project and it has facebook page associated with it where this map was originally posted if you re interested in following the project and or learning more about wolves take look at it www facebook com voyageurswolfproject www facebook com voyageurswolfproject this is brilliant wolves fascinate and terrify me in equal measure incredible animals with amazing social structures the wolves know who each other are that one white wolf gets way the fuck into red range like shit knew should have asked for directionsreminds me of the warrior series about wild cats those white wolves are pretty ballsyget these on live transmitter and put it on website where people can watch instant sports people will watch these wolves and what they do and root for each color white wolf is on an adventure to find itself deep man does yellow have the prime territory they would have to defend incursions from competitors on all sides wonder if they are the most badass these wolves know how to walk in straight lines very well very interesting just wish the white and yellow were seperated by different color so we can distinguish them better some are adventurous some are invasive and some just stay where they are this map is in for great story line of the six packsthe white wolf must listen to manowaroh wow that fascinatingleaked image of mount and blade bannerlord factions and their territoriesall of the wolves are named tobyi worked and hung out with that guy beautiful country out there miss it scale please stay away from this area imgur com bqcbe jpg borders are an imaginary concept made up by humans see humans didnt invent the borders just before seeing this post was looking at the map of racial distribution in new york city and can help but notice the similarities looks like white privilege to me white wolf a hoegreen and yellow have it the hardest wonder if the spots they re in have the best food and water supply dna analysis of markings and droppings to go with this would be nice to compare in years to see if there is some intermingling even their travelling patterns vary for example the red pack has covered most of their defined territory that they don stray from where as the white pack tends to push the boundaries of their territory and then the fire nation attackedmakes sense very rarely go into other people homes as well curious why the white and pink groups have so much open area my guess is that their territory has less usable land maybe gorge or something this thought brought me to the question does each pack have the same territory as far as usable land the two largest territories are the white and pink yet they have the most unused land if each territory is equal in usable land what would dictate this are the packs the same in number or is it because of dominance and fighting among the different packs please tell me there isn a wolf counsel the decides gerrymandering find it interesting how there doesn seem to centralized or preferred spot but rather the entire territory is relatively evenly covered you think they have preferred hunting grounds or game trails or something like that but guess not edit actually it looks like yellow at least has central hub but red is almost completely even wonder if the streaks of density are game trails or part of defined route for grazing animals they prey on there an obvious strait line streakiness here and straight lines tend to be uncommon in nature looks to me like the white pack doesn give one single fuck about pack boundariesnow if only people would do this by minding their own business the ptarmigan dilemma really good book about evolution and natural phenomena behaviour like this great sections on bear activity very similar to this would highly recommend dataisbeautifulyou can see the white signal scouting on the perifery of the territories super cool the white wolf pack don give fuck bro white pack is quite adventurous the white line wolf went hella fari really wonder if the fact that the yellow green wolve packs are used to encounter more neignbouring packs being squeezed in the middle makes them have different perspective on their enviornment than the others mean could they feel more threatened having more neignbours could they feel more pressure to up their game for resources because of more potential rivals interesting to think about that next week on gangland white group just doesn give fuck going through any group they see fit see the seams between the colors avoid those places if you don like stepping in wolf pee am the only one who sees the face of dog in this the hell these white wolves going on cross country trip or something it seems like white takes some risks awesome good one for dataisbeautiful wolves trying to take over tamrielthis is actually my husbands family avoiding each other through out the year besides holidays white wolf goes where tf he wantsinfinity dogswe should enforce open borders for wolves they seem like nazis let make them pay reparations fascinating it makes you wonder what other species have developed more advanced systems of territory than we already realize colorblindgorewhenever see stories studies like this always find myself comparing humans to animals these wolves clearly keep to their own areas for the most part it almost like certain groups of people shouldn intertwine with each other but in today world everything is about accepting all it seems we force cultures to coincide with each other and it doesn always workout the greatest each other territories wolves have territories damn wolves are so racist you think they were humans the chad white wolf pack vs the virgin red wolfpackanyone know if there open access data similar to this bet you can find lot of marked trees at the borders there something oddly familiar about things from california

back to coney boys we re on our own are the longer straight lines just glitches in the gps ve never heard of an lgbt black metal before like the one adventurous grey wolf who snuck deep into red territory and then beelines back home imagine romeo and juliet esque scenario between him and red wolf capulet gang territorydo these packs exchange members to promote cross breeding got bold white wolf one just straight checking red whole edge there unless that a border of some kind in similar color how do you get into wolf pack do you have to be born in it or can you maybe change clan down the line what want to know is why some of those lines are so perfectly straight it sort of looks like wolf head too in profile at least if you squint hard enough purple is the ear white and blue the mouth green has an eye carved out in the middle of it and red the neck wolf countriesblue pack rules very cool thanks for sharing op the six kingdoms green packed is either going to start war or die off slowly they re cornered with no room for expansion source that white wolf is going placeswhite pack lowkey scouting into others areas thoughyellow is in bad spot of war breaks outi honestly thought this was shitty map of the old world white is clearly insanity wolf thank you thomas very cool it almost looks like giant multicolored wolf head thought this was some guy drawing the borders of skyrim red wolves have cardio for days it looks like member of the white pack has no problem mingling in blue territory like some sort of unaccompanied wolfthe white pack love challenges the unseen maps of animalsi believe this is called the competitive exclusion principle species that compete include animals of the same species tend to show these characteristics when living in the same proximity wolves mind your business we ll mind ours humans let fuck some people places things up gang hideouts discoveredjust out of curiosity what the size of each territory meanwhile gold wolf pack is solo on its own island paradise at the topeven wolves are scared of wolves roughly looks like map of the world esp the right sidethere white wolf who don give shit see the white line on the rightchad white wolves don care about your boundaries that a lot of pee m curious about how wolf decides to venture within their territory pink wolf blue wolf and white wolf have the widest spans of territory but red wolf yellow wolf and green wolf are more comprehensive about where they go in their own territory the red wolf appears to be on meth d like to see this crossreferenced with the distance in which wolf could smell or hear or otherwise detect fellow wolves me when see people graduated with at walmart til wolves are bad at mspaintthe white pack doesn give fuckit like scandinavian people waiting for the bus
